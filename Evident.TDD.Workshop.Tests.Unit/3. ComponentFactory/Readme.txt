EXERCISE:

You can either:
1.	Open the ncoiplatform2 sf-solution and write a unit test for one of the Component Factories in the Content Service.
	A good start would be to write a test for PersonalAdviceComponentFactory. 
	Moreover, you can look at ContentService.Tests.Unit.SubscriptionSummaryComponentTests to get an idea how to start and use the same BaseTests class.

OR

2.	Think of something in your own project that you want to write an unit test for.
